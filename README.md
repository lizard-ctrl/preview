# Preview The Future
## Created by Malath Kamaluldeen and Taylor Paydos
For this project we were inspired to work off the desktop icon “preview” which is used to preview images on mac computers. We developed a concept off of that of how preview could be used to “Preview Your Future”. We decided to make a website where you can search for messages from “computer angels” about your future through interactive game play. 

We pulled inspiration from browser web games that experiment with hidden elements, specifically Black Room by Cassie Mcquater, and also from AI generated spiritual messages that are used on apps like co-star. We wanted to look at the ideas of computer as "god", pulling readings to put on our homepage about computer simulation theory contrasted with angel number interpretations. 

This is a narrative experience about finding messages online and how computers, and computer generated objects, could be seen as angels.
