        <p>The line between our <a href="pathone.html">physical</a>world and the spiritual world isn’t as steadfast as you might think. Angels often cross this invisible “line” to communicate with us in the form of Angel numbers – a series of Divine repeating numbers or patterns that hold deep spiritual significance.

            <p> MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark once said that our Universe represents a mathematical structure, reinforcing the long-thought idea that math and nature are intimately entwined. We see evidence of this all around us: the Fibonacci sequence in seashell spirals and hurricanes, the hexagonal patterns of honeycomb, and fractal-like ferns and trees that look strikingly like neuropathways. Even the way we throw a ball or the orbit of a planet is based on calculable trajectories.</p>
           
            <p>These patterns are not sheer coincidence, but rather the way the Divine world communicates ideas and messages to our physical world.</p>
